KYX was born after hours of frustration. Kyler and I had been programming most of the day and were getting fairly agitated and we needed a break through. 
We had originally decided the name would be K&K Programming but our teacher at the time gave us an interesting logo design. 
The K from our names, the X from mine, and the Y from Kyler’s connected to get the design we have today.

Now, what exactly what is KYX? KYX is merely an online portfolio so to speak. It allows the team to demonstrate our programming skills. 
The goal for KYX is to provide website-building services to any customer that may request it.
