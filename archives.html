Before this Kyler an I had been bouncing around with many ideas in our head.
    There was one we  began coding </center> <center> 
    on but quickly realized we simply did not enjoy it. That is why 
    we began working on PORT. 
    Our online PORTfolio!</center>

Kyler and I are attempting to figure out why our css is not affecting the logo
     we are attempting to use.
