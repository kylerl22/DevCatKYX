Well, to say it has been a chaotic week would be a monsterous understatement!
      The team at KYX has been hustling to complete this website to the best of our abilities! 
      However, there have been a few hang-ups. We have yet to add much design to our website
      (Though we do have a logo!) and the PHP has yet to be completed. As a team, neither of us have much experience with 
      PHP so we can only put out noses to the keyboard and keep on coding!
